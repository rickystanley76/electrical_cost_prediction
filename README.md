# Electrical_cost_prediction

# Home Electrical bill(in SEK) and it's Forecasting using Neural Network 
I have collected data from MÃ¤larEnergi of my home electrical usage and it's cost. Using those data I have used Neural Network on Time series data to find out the forecast of my cost for next 12 months, where we also tested the model with last 4 months original data.  
I have used R programming Language and it's different packages, like tidyr, dplyr, forecast and dygraphs for visualization and published the visualtization using rpubs.com
